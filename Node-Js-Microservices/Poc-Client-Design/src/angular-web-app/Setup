To create a new Angular application, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Install Angular CLI**
Ensure you have the Angular CLI installed. If not, install it globally using:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify the installation and version:
```bash
ng version
```

---

### 2. **Create a New Angular Application**
Run the following command to create a new Angular app:
```bash
ng new <app-name>
```
Replace `<app-name>` with the desired name for your application (e.g., `my-angular-app`).

---

### 3. **Answer Prompts**
You'll be prompted to configure your project:
1. **Add Angular routing?** 
   - Choose `Yes` or `No` based on whether you need routing.
2. **Choose stylesheet format** (CSS, SCSS, SASS, or LESS):
   - Select your preferred option (default is CSS).

---

### 4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
After the app is created, navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd <app-name>
```

---

### 5. **Run the Angular Application**
Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

By default, the application will be accessible at:
```plaintext
http://localhost:4200/
```

---

### 6. **Open the App in a Browser**
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see your new Angular application running.

---

### Notes:
- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Use `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify.
- If you need a specific Angular version, install the desired version of Angular CLI before creating the app:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli@<version>
  ```

Now you have a brand-new Angular application ready for development!
