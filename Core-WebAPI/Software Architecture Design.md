### Types of Software Architecture Design

**1. Layered Architecture**
The layered architecture pattern, also known as the n-tier architecture, organizes the system into layers, with each layer serving a specific function. Common layers include presentation, business logic, and data access. This pattern is straightforward and facilitates separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale the application. However, it can lead to tight coupling if not properly managed.

*Example*: An e-commerce application where the user interface, business logic for processing orders, and database access are all separated into distinct layers.

**2. Event-Driven Architecture**
This architecture revolves around the production, detection, and reaction to events. It consists of event producers and consumers, with a broker or mediator to manage the event flow. It's particularly useful for systems requiring high responsiveness and scalability.

*Example*: A stock trading platform where various modules react to changes in stock prices, user actions, or external events.

**3. Microkernel Architecture**
Also known as the plug-in architecture, the microkernel pattern separates the core functionality from extended functionality through plug-ins. The core provides minimal essential services, while additional features are added via plug-ins.

*Example*: Operating systems like Linux, where the kernel manages basic operations and modules provide additional functionalities like file systems or device drivers.

**4. Microservices Architecture**
This pattern decomposes a system into a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service represents a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. It's suitable for applications that require flexibility and continuous deployment.

*Example*: Netflix uses microservices to manage its vast array of functionalities, from user recommendations to content streaming.

**5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
SOA designs systems as a suite of services that can be reused and shared. Services communicate over a network using a common protocol, often SOAP or REST, making them accessible across different platforms.

*Example*: An enterprise system where various business processes like billing, customer service, and inventory management are implemented as separate services.

**6. Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
The MVC pattern separates an application into three main components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (UI), and the Controller (input logic). This separation allows for efficient code organization and independent development of components.

*Example*: Web applications where the user interface is separated from the data processing logic, such as a blog site with separate modules for user management, content creation, and display.

**7. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
CQRS splits the system into two parts: one for handling commands (which change the state) and another for handling queries (which retrieve data). This separation allows for optimization and scalability of read and write operations.

*Example*: An online marketplace where product listings (queries) are read frequently, but order processing (commands) involves complex state changes.

**8. Serverless Architecture**
In serverless architecture, developers focus on writing code without managing server infrastructure. Cloud providers automatically manage the infrastructure, scaling, and execution. This model is cost-effective for applications with variable workloads.

*Example*: AWS Lambda functions that execute in response to events like HTTP requests, database updates, or file uploads.

**9. Space-Based Architecture**
This architecture is designed to handle high data loads by distributing the processing across multiple nodes. It involves two main components: a processing unit and a data space. It's useful for applications requiring high availability and scalability.

*Example*: Financial services applications that process large volumes of transactions and require fault tolerance.
