Designing a system architecture for microservices involves several key principles and best practices to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. Below is a detailed example architecture design for a microservice-based application:

### 1. **Overall System Architecture**

#### Key Components:
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all clients, handling request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
- **Service Discovery**: Registers and locates microservices.
- **Microservices**: Small, independently deployable services each responsible for a specific business function.
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice has its own database to ensure loose coupling.
- **Event Bus**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration to manage service configurations.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Centralized logging and monitoring system to track service health and performance.
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 2. **Microservice Architecture Design**

#### Example Services:
- **User Service**: Manages user data and authentication.
- **Order Service**: Handles order processing and management.
- **Product Service**: Manages product catalog and inventory.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing.

### 3. **Detailed Architecture**

#### 3.1 API Gateway
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Request routing to appropriate microservices.
  - Rate limiting, load balancing, authentication.
  - API composition for complex requests.
- **Tools**: Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway.

#### 3.2 Service Discovery
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Automatically register microservices instances.
  - Enable dynamic lookup and load balancing.
- **Tools**: Consul, Eureka, Zookeeper.

#### 3.3 Microservices
Each microservice should:
- **Have a Single Responsibility**: Each service should have a well-defined purpose.
- **Be Independently Deployable**: Deploy and scale services independently.
- **Communicate Over Lightweight Protocols**: Prefer REST, gRPC, or messaging queues.

Example: **User Service**
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /users/register` – Register a new user.
  - `POST /users/login` – Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /users/{id}` – Get user details.
- **Database**: A dedicated user database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

Example: **Order Service**
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /orders` – Create a new order.
  - `GET /orders/{id}` – Retrieve order details.
  - `PUT /orders/{id}` – Update order status.
- **Database**: A dedicated order database.

#### 3.4 Database per Service
- **Principle**: Each microservice has its own database to avoid tight coupling.
- **Type of Databases**: Choose the database type based on the service requirements (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).

#### 3.5 Event Bus
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Enable asynchronous communication between services.
  - Ensure eventual consistency across services.
- **Tools**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS.

Example: **Order Created Event**
- When an order is created, the `Order Service` publishes an `OrderCreated` event.
- **Subscribers**:
  - `Inventory Service` subscribes to update stock levels.
  - `Notification Service` subscribes to notify the user.

#### 3.6 Configuration Management
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Centralized configuration storage.
  - Dynamic configuration changes without redeploying services.
- **Tools**: Spring Cloud Config, Consul.

#### 3.7 Logging and Monitoring
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Centralize logs for analysis and troubleshooting.
  - Monitor service health and performance metrics.
- **Tools**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, Grafana.

### 4. **Security**

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 or JWT for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions.
- **Responsibilities**: Automated testing, linting, and building of microservices.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Tools**: Spinnaker, ArgoCD.
- **Responsibilities**: Automated deployment to staging and production environments.

### 6. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**

#### Circuit Breaker
- **Pattern**: Use circuit breaker pattern to handle service failures gracefully.
- **Tools**: Hystrix, Resilience4j.

#### Load Balancing
- **Pattern**: Distribute traffic evenly across service instances.
- **Tools**: NGINX, HAProxy.

Here is a simplified example architecture diagram:
